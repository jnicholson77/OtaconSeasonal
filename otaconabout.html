        <h3>Who is Otacon anyways?</h3>
      Oh, I see, you must not of had a PlayStation in the 90’s, huh? Or maybe you were more of a Nintendo 64 guy? Anyways, I am the beloved character from the Metal Gear Solid series made by Hideo Kojima, of course! I am known throughout the entire Metal Gear universe as being a giant otaku, or connoisseur of the finest anime. This is my website that I work on when I’m not busy trying to keep Snake out of trouble. It’s all about anime to watch made by the anime expert himself. So, heed my advice on the pages of this website and maybe even you, one day, can consider yourself an otaku as well.

        <h3>Anime? How did I even get on this website? Where am I?</h3>
      Listen to me, dear reader. Anime could be argued to be one of the fastest growing entertainment mediums currently. It has skyrocketed in popularity and has taken over American pop culture much like it did Japanese culture a mere three decades ago! From Pokémon to Hello Kitty to Transformers to even Fortnite, anime has influenced the American entertainment industry in more ways than you can count. What’s even better is that there is an anime or category of anime for everyone! Like action and fighting? We have plenty of that! Like seeing cute girls or handsome boys doing cute or handsome things? Anime’s got that in spades. Want psychological thrillers or intense dramas (my personal favorites)? Of course, we have that! So, take a look around and I bet you’ll find some anime you enjoy, eventually.

      <h3>Fortnite, really? That seems a bit farfetched…</h3>
      No, really! Fortnite is a giant battle royale. The entire genre of battle royale games can be traced back to the Japanese manga, Battle Royale, which depicted the situation in which one hundred people are launched onto a remote island out of plane and forced to kill each other for survival. In my humble opinion, all these game developers need to stop suing each other and give thanks to the anime gods for coming up with such an awesome idea for them to exploit! Take that ninja!
