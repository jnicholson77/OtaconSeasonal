      <h3>Dororo</h3>
      <img src="dororo.jpg" id="dororo"/>
      <p>
        This samurai anime tells the story of Hyakkimaru and Dororo as they embark on a journey to get
        back Hyakkimaru's stolen body parts. Yes, you heard that right. Hyakkimaru's father was a feudal lord
        who made a deal with the devil to bring prosperity to his land, but in return he had to sacrifice his first born son's
        body parts to the demons. Hyakkimaru and Dororo must fight these demons to reclaim Hyakkimaru's senses and body parts and get
        revenge on his father. It's a wild, dramatic ride!

      <p>
        This series's main character is a middle school student named Mob who just so happens to be an esper. The anime follows him
        and his master, Reigen, who just so happens to not have esper powers. Still, Mob is a caring kid and helps Reigen out with his
        business, Spirits Consultation and Such. Oh I almost forgot, if Mob gets too emotional and gets to 100% anger, he explodes.

      <h3>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</h3>
      <img src="loveiswar.jpg" id="love"/>
      <p>
        This anime takes place in, you guessed it, a good ol' prestigious Japanese high school. This series centers around the student council president
        and the student council vice president and their romantic hijinks. They are in love with each other, but neither wants to admit it to the other
        because in their minds admitting you love someone is defeat and love is war. Tom-foolery naturally ensues.

      <h3>The Promised Neverland</h3>
      <img src="promised.jpg" id="promised"/>
      <p>
        This anime takes place at Grace Field House, an orphange for children. The children are well-fed, clean, and have everything they could ever need.
        They are taken care of by a woman named Isabella who they refer to as "Momma". There are only a few rules: never go to the gate leading to the
        outside world and when a child turns 12 years old they are adopted into a family and leave the orphanage. But what if the orphanage was really just
        a farm that harvested children as food for demons? No, Otacon's imagination is not getting away from him. That is literally the plot of this horrific
        anime.

      <h3>The Rising of the Shield Hero</h3>
      <img src="rising.jpg" id="rising"/>
      <p>
        Young student Naofumi is sucked into a library book and transported to a different world where he is one of 4 heroes that are tasked with saving the people of this world: the
        sword hero, the spear hero, the bow hero, and the shield hero. He just so happens to become the shield hero who everyone despises because what can a man with just a shield
        really do? Turns out, not a whole lot besides piss everyone off.
