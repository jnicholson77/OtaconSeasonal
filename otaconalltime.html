    <h1>Otacon's Three Favorite Anime of All Time</h1>
    <p>
      <h3>Steins;Gate</h3>
      <img src="steinsgate.png" id="steinsgate"/>
      <p>
        Based on a series of visual novels, this anime is a scientist's (like myself) dream...
        or maybe nightmare. It follows a self-proclaimed mad-scientist and his quest to conquer
       time itself. He gets his time machine to work, but at what cost?
     </p>

      <h3>Clannad and Clannad:After Story</h3>
      <img src="clannad.jpg" id="clannad"/>
      <p>
        Also based on a set of visual novels, Clannad starts like plenty of anime do, following high schoolers around.
        This anime seeks to break the high school romance cliche by showing what happens to the high school sweethearts after high school ends.
        What follows is a tale of love, family, and lost. Otacon cried more than he ever has before watching the last 10 episodes of this
        series, so viewer beware!

      <h3>Bakemonogatari</h3>
      <img src="bakemonogatari.jpg" id="bake"/>
      <p>
        Created by the legendary Japanese novelist, Nisio Isin, the Monogatari series follows Koyomi Araragi
        as he encounters various abberations, or monsters, throughout his journeys in his small, sleepy hometown. A homesick
        crab inhabits his girlfriend, a local basketball star grows a monkey's paw, and Koyomi himself is bitten by a vampire!
        It is animated by the prestigious Shaft Studio who brings their avant-garde style to the storyboard to give this anime
        a real unique feel. There are many books and series in the monogatari series so the fun will never stop!
